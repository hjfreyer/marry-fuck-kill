Intro
-----

This is the code for Marry Fuck Kill, a web game. The main directories are:

marry-fuck-kill: The appengine application. This handles the database and JSON
    interface, and provides some debugging facilities.

MfkMaker: The creation interface (a GWT app).

It's all horribly messy, and mostly an excuse for to learn some GWT and App
Engine.

Up-to-date version always available at the
[Official Location](https://github.com/hjfreyer/marry-fuck-kill).

Notes
-----
The GWT code must be built with `build_gwt.sh` before the JS functions.

For debugging the GWT code, hosted mode is best. You can add
`?gwt.codesvr=127.0.0.1:9997` (with appropriate port) to the URL of the GWT
page.

You may wish to uncomment the `/stats` handler in app.yaml and the stats
wrapper in appengine_config.py to enable datastore stats gathering.

See also the `TODO` file.
