Intro
-----

This is the code for Marry Fuck Kill, a web game.

Up-to-date version always available at the
[Official Location](https://github.com/hjfreyer/marry-fuck-kill).

Hacking
-------

In order to build the dev server, you need to have the appengine
python runtime installed, as well as npm. As a one-time set up (or if
you pull and something seems weird), run `npm install`.

After that, run `npm start` to bring up the dev server on
localhost:8080. Sass files and other preprocessed junk will get
automatically updated by grunt under the covers.
