=== Intro ===
This is the MFK code. The main directories are:

marry-fuck-kill: The appengine application. This handles the database and JSON
        interface, and provides some debugging facilities.
MfkWeb: The voting interface (a GWT app).
MfkMake: The creation interface (a GWT app).

It's all horribly messy, and mostly an excuse for me to learn a bit about GWT
and App Engine.

=== Tasks ===
- basic stats
  - Histogram for individual triple (right after rating, HotOrNot style)

=== Hosted Mode GWT Debugging ===
0) ./marry-fuck-kill/gwt-war/ is seeded with an ant build.
1) Run the devmode gwt server in ./MfkWeb with -noserver, etc ("ant devmode"
   works; or set eclipse args to be the same as build.xml)
2) Start the appengine project in ./marry-fuck-kill.
3) Access http://localhost:8080/MfkWeb.html?gwt.codesvr=127.0.0.1:9997 and
   debug in style.

If RPCs are blank, be wary of the browser's same-origin policy. Obviously make
sure you're accessing the GWT app through the appengine dev webserver. Check
"localhost" vs "127.0.0.1", if that gets embedded anywhere (it shouldn't).
