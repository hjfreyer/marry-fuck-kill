=== Intro ===
This is the code for Marry Fuck Kill, a web game. The main directories are:

marry-fuck-kill: The appengine application. This handles the database and JSON
        interface, and provides some debugging facilities.
MfkMaker: The creation interface (a GWT app).

It's all horribly messy, and mostly an excuse for me to learn a bit about GWT
and App Engine.

=== Notes ===
The GWT code must be built with build_gwt.sh before the JS functions.

For debugging the GWT code, hosted mode is best -- add
"?gwt.codesvr=127.0.0.1:9997" (or the appropriate port) to the GWT page.

See also the "TODO" file.
