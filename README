Tasks:
- canonical triple order
- pretty it
- add images to entities
- basic stats
  - Histogram for individual triple
- unduplicate MfkWeb/MfkWeb.{html,css} and
  marry-fuck-kill/gwt-war/MfkWeb.{html,css}.


DEBUGGING NOTES:

0) ./marry-fuck-kill/gwt-war/ is seeded with an ant build, and /gwt is mapped
   to it. You shouldn't have to re-do that.
1) Run the devmode gwt server in ./MfkWeb with -noserver, etc ("ant devmode"
   works; or set eclipse args to be the same as build.xml)
2) Start the appengine project in ./marry-fuck-kill.
3) Access http://localhost:8080/gwt/MfkWeb.html?gwt.codesvr=127.0.0.1:9997 and
   debug in style.
