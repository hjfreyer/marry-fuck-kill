        <h2>What is it?</h2>
        <p>
          Marry-Fuck-Kill (MFK) is a simple game where you are presented with
          three items. They could be people, places, concepts, or commom
          household objects. You must then decide whether you would marry, fuck,
          or kill each one of them -- you must do each exactly once to each item.
        </p>

        <p>
          The offline version of the game is a way to kill some time while you're
          stuck in a Costa Rican airport for three hours when your flight is
          delayed.
